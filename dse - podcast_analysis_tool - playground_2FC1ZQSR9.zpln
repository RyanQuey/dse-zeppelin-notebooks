More recently, Nickolas and Fountech.ai received widespread national coverage in likes of ITV News, The Daily Mail, Metro, and The Daily Express for a survey of over 2,000 UK consumers investigating public trust of AI. The results are striking! Most notably, over a fifth (22%) of consumers would trust AI to handle political negotiations (such as Brexit) over politicians. In comparison, more than a quarter (28%) would trust AI to care for an elderly relative.  We discuss these findings in greater depth, as well as touch upon what a lack of AI education could mean for future tech developments.
