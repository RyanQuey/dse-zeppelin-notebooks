It’s particularly important for those people to understand that this is a different type of beast.” Machine learning is something that many business are starting to tack onto their existing processes. Yet, to add machine learning capabilities after the fact is often a fools errand. Joshua argues that machine learning cannot be an afterthought, but rather must be custom developed to suit the specific problem or question that each company is trying to answer. His company, Wise.io, tackles this challenge of helping business build ground up machine learning applications that generate accurate predictions for use in an array of business processes. Joshua Bloom is the cofounder and CTO of Wise.io. He is also an astrophysicist, and a professor of astronomy at UC Berkeley. Questions  What is a machine learning system? What is the broader impact of this improved ease of use of machine learning algorithms? How do you think data scientists are stratified? What does Wiseio do?

Understanding how to utilize these tools and display data is necessary for a data scientist to communicate with people in other domains. In this episode, Srini Kadamati hosts a discussion with Jake VanderPlas about the Python ecosystem for data science and the different attempts at creating a data visualization library. Jake VanderPlas is the Director of Research for Physical Sciences at the University of Washington’s eScience institute, where he also received his PhD in Astronomy. In addition to contributing to many Python data science libraries like scikit-learn, scipy, numpy, and matplotlib, he’s written multiple books that have been published by O’Reilly and has given many talks on data science tools and techniques. He’s also the co-creator of the Altair project, which is a declarative data visualization library for Python built on the Vega-Lite visualization grammar.

How do you translate a sentence from one human language into another? This seems like a problem that computers are well-suited to solve. Languages follow well-defined rules, we have lots of sample data to train our machine learning models. And yet, the problem has not been solvedlargely because languages don’t always follow rules. We have idioms and subtle contextual clues that make it hard to provide a computer with hard and fast rules for translation. Unbabel is a company whose solution to translation puts a human in the loop to correct the error-prone translations that computers often make. In this episode, Vasco Pedro joins the show to explain Unbabel’s approach to translation, its technology stack, and the business applications for translation.

Lots of engineers know these languages, and their ecosystems have great library support. But these languages have some issues around deployment, reproducibility, and other areas. The programming language Golang presents an appealing alternative for data scientists. Daniel Whitenack transitioned from doing most of his data science work in Python to writing code in Golang. In this episode, Daniel explains the workflow of a data scientist and discusses why Go is useful. We also talk about the blurry line between data science and data engineering, and how Pachyderm is useful for versioning and reproducibility. Daniel works at Pachyderm, and listeners who are more curious about it can check out the episode I did with Pachyderm founder Joe Doliner. Transcript Transcript provided by We Edit Podcasts.

But machine learning is still hard. Debugging a machine learning model is a slow, messy process.  A bug in a machine learning model does not always mean a complete failure. Your model could continue to deliver usable results even in the presence of a mistaken implementation. Perhaps you made a mistake when cleaning your data, leading to an incorrectly trained model. It is a general rule in computer science that partial failures are harder to fix than complete failures. In this episode, Zayd Enam describes the different dimensions on which a machine learning model can develop an error. Zayd is a machine learning researcher at the Stanford AI Lab, so I also asked him about AI risk, job displacement, and academia versus industry.

The question is not whether fraud will occur on your system, but rather how much of it you can detect and prevent. If a payments company flags too many transactions as fraudulent, then real transactions might accidentally get flagged as well. But if you don’t reject enough of the fraudulent transactions, you might not be able to make any money at all. Because fraud detection is such a difficult optimization problem, it is a good fit for machine learning. Today’s guest Michael Manapat works on machine learning fraud detection at Stripe. This conversation explores aspects of both data science and data engineering. Michael seems to benefit from having a depth of knowledge in both aspects of the data pipeline, which made me question whether data science and data engineering are roles that an engineering organization wants to separate. This is the third in a series of episodes about Stripe engineering. Throughout these episodes, we’ve tried to give a picture for how Stripe’s engineering culture works. We hope to do more experimental series like this in the future.

The sample size of a biological data set is often too small to make confident judgments about the biological system being studied.  During Jason Knight’s PhD research, the RNA sequence data that he was studying was not significant enough to make strong conclusions about the gene regulatory networks he was trying to understand. After working in academia, and then at Human Longevity, Inc Jason came to the conclusion that the best way to work towards biology breakthroughs was to work on the computer systems that enable those breakthroughs. He went to work at Nervana Systems on hardware and software for deep learning. Nervana was subsequently acquired by Intel. In this episode, we discuss how machine learning can be applied to biology today, and how industrial research and development is key to enabling more breakthroughs in the future. The main lesson I took away from this show is that while we have seen phenomenal breakthroughs in certain areas of healthlike image recognition applied to diabetic retinopathy or skin cancerthe challenges of reverse engineering our genome to understand how nucleic acids fit together into humans are still out of reach, and improving the hardware used for deep learning will be necessary to tackle these kinds of informational challenges.

Examples of these systems include financial markets, robot soccer matches, and automated warehouses. Today’s guest Peter Stone is a professor of computer science who specializies in multiagent systems and robotics. In this episode, we discuss some of the canonical problems of multiagent systems, which have some overlap with the canonical problems of distributed systemsfor example, the problems of coordinating between different agents with varying levels of trust resembles the problem of establishing consistency across servers in a database cluster. Peter has recently contributed to the 100 year study of artificial intelligence, so we also had a chance to discuss the opportunities and roadblocks for AI in the near future. And since Peter teaches computer science at my alma mater, UT Austin, I had to ask him a few questions about the curriculum.

The “hedge” refers to the fact that the investors often try to diversify their strategies so that the direction of their bets are less correlated, and they can be successful in a variety of future scenarios. Engineering-focused hedge funds have used what might be called “machine learning” for a long time to predict what will happen in the future. Numerai is a hedge fund that crowdsources its investment strategies by allowing anyone to train models against Numerai’s data. A model that succeeds in a simulated environment will be adopted by Numerai and used within its real money portfolio. The engineers who create the models are rewarded in proportion to how well the models perform. Xander Dunn is a software engineer at Numerai and in this episode he explains what a hedge fund is, why the traditional strategies are not optimal, and how Numerai creates the right incentive structure to crowdsource market intelligence. This interview was fun and thought provokingNumerai is one of those companies that makes me very excited about the future. Transcript Transcript provided by We Edit Podcasts.

A single musician is often selecting the instruments, programming the drum loops, composing the melodies, and mixing the track to get the right overall atmosphere.  With so much work to do on each song, popular musicians need to simplifythe result is that pop music today consists of simple melodies without much chord progression. Magenta is a project out of Google Brain to design algorithms that learn how to generate art and music. One goal of Magenta is to advance the state of the art in machine intelligence for music and art generation. Another goal is to build a community of artists, coders, and machine learning researchers who can collaborate. Engineers today are happy to outsource server management to a cloud service provider. Similarly, a musician can use Magenta for creation of a melody, so she can focus on other aspects of a song, such as instrumentation. Doug Eck is a research scientist at Google. In today’s episode, we explore the Magenta project and the future of music. Software Engineering Daily is having our third Meetup, Wednesday May 3rd at Galvanize in San Francisco.

Some people thought this wouldn’t be possible. Sure, we can teach a computer to beat a human at Go or Chess. Those games have a smaller decision space. There is no hidden information. There is no bluffing. Poker must be different! It is too human to be automated. The game space of poker is different than that of Go. It has 10^160 different situationswhich is more than the number of atoms in the universe. And the game space keeps getting bigger as the stack sizes of the two competitors gets bigger. But it is still possible for a computer to beat a human at calculating game theory optimal decisionsif you approach the problem correctly. Libratus was developed by CMU professor Tuomas Sandholm, along with my guest today Noam Brown. The Libratus team taught their AI the rules of poker, they gave it a reward function (to win as much money as possible), and they told it to optimize that reward function. Then they had Libratus train itself with simulations. After enough training, Libratus was ready to crush human competitors, which it did in hilarious, entertaining fashion. There is a video from Engadget on YouTube about the AI competing against professional humans. In this episode, Noam Brown explains how they built Libratus, what it means for poker players, and what the implications are for humanityif we can automate poker, what can’t we automate?

These models improve over time using stochastic gradient descent. When a model gets big enough, the training must be broken up across multiple machines. Two strategies for doing this are “model parallelism” which divides the model across machines and “data parallelism” which divides the data across multiple copies of the model. Distributed deep learning brings together two advanced software engineering concepts: distributed systems and deep learning. In this episode, Will Constable, the head of distributed deep learning algorithms at Intel Nervana, joins the show to give us a refresher on deep learning and explain how to parallelize training a model.

Fully autonomous systems like Waymo are being piloted in less complex circumstances. Human-in-the-loop systems like Tesla Autopilot navigate drivers when it is safe to do so, and lets the human take control in ambiguous circumstances. Computers are great at memorization, but not yet great at reasoning. We cannot enumerate to a computer every single circumstance that a car might find itself in. The computer needs to perceive its surroundings, plan how to take action, execute control over the situation, and respond to changing circumstances inside and outside of the car. Lex Fridman has worked on autonomous vehicles with companies like Google and Tesla. He recently taught a class on deep learning for semi-autonomous vehicles at MIT, which is freely available online. There was so much ground to cover in this conversation. Most of the conversation was higher level. How do you even approach the problem? What is the hardware and software architecture of a car? I enjoyed talking to Lex, and if you want to hear more from him check out his podcast Take It Uneasy, which is about jiu jitsu, judo, wrestling, and learning.

A user who has just read a great news article might want to read articles similar to it. A user who has just taken a picture of a dog might want to search for dog photos similar to it. In both of these cases, the query object is turned into a vector and compared to the vectors representing the objects in the search index. Facebook contains a lot of news articles and a lot of dog pictures. How do you index and query all that information efficiently? Much of that data is unlabeled. How can you use deep learning to classify entities and add more richness to the vectors? Jeff Johnson is a research engineer at Facebook. He joins the show to discuss how similarity search works at scale, including how to represent that data and the tradeoffs of this kind of search engine across speed, memory usage, and accuracy. Notes: Jeffs blog post about similarity search Sponsors   Spring Framework gives developers an environment for building cloud native projects.

Today, machine learning is already being used to diagnose diabetic retinopathy and improve radiology accuracy. Someday, an AI assistant will assist a doctor in working through a complicated differential diagnosis.  Our hospitals look roughly the same today as they did ten years ago, because getting new technology into the hands of doctors and nurses is a slow processjust ask anyone who has tried to sell software in the healthcare space. But technological advancement in healthcare is inevitable. Cosima Gretton is a medical doctor and a product manager with KariusDX, a company that is building diagnostic tools for infectious diseases. She writes about the future of healthcare, exploring the ways that workflows will change and how human biases could impact the diagnostic processeven in the presence of sophisticated AI.

Modern machine learning techniques are able to turn that data into extremely useful models. Salesforce users have been entering petabytes of data into the company’s CRM tool since 1999. With its Einstein suite of products, Salesforce is using that data to build new product features and APIs. Simon Chan is the senior director of product management with Einstein. He oversees the efforts to give longtime Salesforce customers new value, and the efforts to build brand new APIs for image recognition and recommendation systems, which can form the backbone of entirely new businesses. Companies spend billions of dollars on sales and marketing, and I wanted to understand where the best opportunities for Salesforce were. Simon and I spent much of our time exploring higher level applications, but we got to lower level engineering eventually.

The post Artificial Intelligence APIs with Simon Chan appeared first on Software Engineering Daily. \nhttp://softwareengineeringdaily.com/?p\u003d3957\t Machines understand the world through mathematical representations. In order to train a machine learning model, we need to describe everything in terms of numbers.  Images, words, and sounds are too abstract for a computer. But a series of numbers is a representation that we can all agree on, whether we are a computer or a human. In recent shows, we have explored how to train machine learning models to understand images and video. Today, we explore words. You might be thinking”isn’t a word easy to understand? Can’t you just take the dictionary definition?” A dictionary definition does not capture the richness of a word. Dictionaries do not give you a way to measure similarity between one word and all other words in a given language. Word2vec is a system for defining words in terms of the words that appear close to that word. For example, the sentence “Howard is sitting in a Starbucks cafe drinking a cup of coffee” gives an obvious indication that the words “cafe,” “cup,” and “coffee” are all related. With enough sentences like that, we can start to understand the entire language. Adrian Colyer is a venture capitalist with Accel, and blogs about technical topics such as word2vec. We talked about word2vec specifically, and the deep learning space more generally. We also explored how the rapidly improving tools around deep learning are changing the venture investment landscape. If you like this episode, we have done many other shows about machine learning with guests like Matt Zeiler, the founder of Clarif.ai and Francois Chollet, the creator of Keras.

I need to make an algorithm to build an index of all the pictures on the Internet. That index can define the different features of my images. I can find mathematical features in each image that describe that image. The mathematical features can be represented by a matrix of numbers. Then I can run the same algorithm on the picture of my dog, which will make another matrix of numbers. I can compare the matrix representing my dog picture to the matrices of all the pictures on the internet. This is what Google and Facebook doand we covered this topic in our episode about similarity search a few weeks ago. Today, we evaluate a similar problem: searching images within Squarespace. Squarespace is a platform where users can easily build their own website for blogging, e-commerce, or anything else.

A model is trained in the cloud and deployed to a device. The device engages with the real world, gathering more data. That data is sent back to the cloud, where it can improve the model. From the processor level to the software frameworks at the top of the stack, the impact of deep learning is so significant that it is driving changes everywhere. At the hardware level, new chips are being designed to perform the matrix calculations at the heart of a neural net. At the software level, programmers are empowered by new frameworks like Neon and TensorFlow. In between the programmer and the hardware, middleware can transform software models into representations that can execute with better performance. Milena Marinova is the senior director of AI solutions at the Intel AI products group, and joins the show today to talk about modern applications of machine learning and how those translate into Intel’s business strategy around hardware, software, and cloud.

Cameras from all angles capture the players making their way around the court, dribbling, passing, and shooting. With computer vision, a computer can build a well-defined understanding for what a sport looks like. With other machine learning techniques, the computer can make predictions by combining historical data with a game that is going on right now. Second Spectrum is a company that builds products for analyzing sports. At major basketball arenas, Second Spectrum cameras sit above the court, recording the game and feeding that information to the cloud. Second Spectrum’s servers crunch on the raw data, processing it through computer vision and putting it into deep learning models. The output can be utilized by teams, coaches, and fans. Yu-Han Chang and Jeff Su are co-founders of Second Spectrum. They join the show to describe the data pipeline of Second Spectrum from the cameras on the basketball court to the entertaining visualizations. After talking to them, I am convinced that machine learning will completely change how sports are playedand will probably open up a platform for new sports to be invented.
